# PostgreSQL HTTP Client


## Motivation

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to write a trigger that called a web service? Either to get back a result, or to poke that service into refreshing itself against the new state of the database?

This extension is for that. 

## Examples

    > SELECT urlencode('my special string''s & things?');

                  urlencode              
    -------------------------------------
     my+special+string%27s+%26+things%3F
    (1 row)


    > SELECT content FROM http_get('http://localhost');

                       content                    
    ----------------------------------------------
     <html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>
    (1 row)


    > SELECT status, content_type, content FROM http_get('http://localhost');

     status | content_type |                   content                    
    --------+--------------+----------------------------------------------
        200 | text/html    | <html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>
    (1 row)

  
    > SELECT (unnest(headers)).* FROM http_get('http://localhost');

To POST to a URL using a data payload instead of parameters embedded in the URL, use the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.

    SELECT status, content 
      FROM http_post('http://localhost/myform',
                     'myvar=myval&foo=bar',
                     'application/x-www-form-urlencoded);


Remember to [URL encode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) content that includes any "special" characters (really, anything other than a-z and 0-9). 

    SELECT status, content 
      FROM http_post('http://localhost/myform',
                     'myvar=' || urlencode('my special string & things?'),
                     'application/x-www-form-urlencoded);

To access binary content, you must coerce the content from the default `varchar` representation to a `bytea` representation using the `textsend` function. Using the default `varchar::bytea` cast will not work, as the cast will stop the first time it hits a zero-valued byte (common in binary data).

    WITH 
      http AS ( 
        SELECT * FROM http_get('http://localhost/PoweredByMacOSXLarge.gif') 
      ), 
      headers AS (
        SELECT (unnest(headers)).* FROM http
      ) 
    SELECT 
      http.content_type,
      length(textsend(http.content)) AS length_binary, 
      headers.value AS length_headers 
    FROM http, headers 
    WHERE field = 'Content-Length';
    
     content_type | length_binary | length_headers

## Concepts

Every HTTP call is a made up of an `http_request` and an `http_response`.

         Composite type "public.http_request"
        Column    |       Type        | Modifiers 
    --------------+-------------------+-----------
     method       | http_method       | 
     uri          | character varying | 
     headers      | http_header[]     | 
     content_type | character varying | 
     content      | character varying | 

        Composite type "public.http_response"
        Column    |       Type        | Modifiers 
    --------------+-------------------+-----------
     status       | integer           | 
     content_type | character varying | 
     headers      | http_header[]     | 
     content      | character varying | 

The utility functions, `http_get()`, `http_post()`, `http_put()`, and `http_delete()` are just wrappers around a master function, `http(http_request)` that returns `http_response`.

The `headers` field for requests and response is a PostgreSQL array of type `http_header` which is just a simple tuple.

      Composite type "public.http_header"
     Column |       Type        | Modifiers 
    --------+-------------------+-----------
     field  | character varying | 
     value  | character varying | 

As seen in the examples, you can unspool the array of `http_header` tuples into a result set using the PostgreSQL `unnest()` function on the array. From there you select out the particular header you are interested in.

## Keep-Alive

By default each request uses a fresh connection and assures that the connection is closed when the request is done.  This behavior reduces the chance of consuming system resources (sockets) as the extension runs over extended periods of time.

High-performance applications may wish to enable keep-alive and connection persistence to reduce latency and enhance throughput.  The following GUC variable changes the behavior of the http extension to maintain connections as long as possible:

    http.keepalive = 'on'

## Timeouts

By default a 5 second timeout is set for the completion of a request.  If a different timeout is desired the following GUC variable can be used to set it in milliseconds:

    http.timeout_msec = 200
    
## CAInfo

By default for SSL connections, the default locations used by curl to find the CA Bundle are searched.
On some systems, there may not be a default or the default is not under user control.
This setting allows you to overwrite the CURLOPT_CAINFO used by curl.

### Windows example
    SET http.cainfo = 'C:\SSL\Certs\ca-bundle.crt';
    
### UNIX example
    SET http.cainfo = '/share/ssl/ca-bundle.crt';

## Functions

* `http_header(field VARCHAR, value VARCHAR)` returns `http_header`
* `http(request http_request)` returns `http_response`
* `http_get(uri VARCHAR)` returns `http_response`
* `http_post(uri VARCHAR, content VARCHAR, content_type VARCHAR)` returns `http_response`
* `http_put(uri VARCHAR, content VARCHAR, content_type VARCHAR)` returns `http_response`
* `http_delete(uri VARCHAR)` returns `http_resonse`
* `urlencode(string VARCHAR)` returns `text`

## Installation

### UNIX

If you have PostgreSQL devel packages and CURL devel packages installed (>= 0.7.20), you should have `pg_config` and `curl-config` on your path, so you should be able to just run `make`, then `make install`, then in your database `CREATE EXTENSION http`.

If you already installed version 1.0 and you just want to upgrade, then `ALTER EXTENSION http UPDATE TO '1.1'`.

### Windows

There is a build available at [postgresonline](http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/archives/371-http-extension.html), not maintained by me.

## Why This is a Bad Idea

- "What happens if the web page takes a long time to return?" Your SQL call will just wait there until it does. Make sure your web service fails fast.
- "What if the web page returns junk?" Your SQL call will have to test for junk before doing anything with the payload.
- "What if the web page never returns?" I've found this code can really hang a back-end hard. The curl timeout settings need more testing and tweaking for faster failure and timeout.


## To Do

- The new http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/bgworker.html background worker support could be used to set up an HTTP request queue, so that pgsql-http can register a request and callback and then return immediately.
- Inevitably some web server will return gzip content (Content-Encoding) without being asked for it. Handling that gracefully would be good.
